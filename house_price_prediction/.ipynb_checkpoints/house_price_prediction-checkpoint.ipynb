However, the training $R^2$-score of 0.7 is still unsatisfactory, and the comparison above shows that for some houses, the predicted price is very far from the actual price. The result indicates that **underfitting** still occurs and calls for an even better model. The underfitting is likely due to the nonlinear nature of the data; in this case, no linear model would fit the data well."

    "The Random Forest regressor achieves a good $R^2$-score, which is above 0.85, on the test set. In the meantime, we notice a gap between the training score (above 0.98) and the test score (above 0.85). In general, an ML model is expected to perform worse on the test set than on the training set because the model was given the true output values of the training examples when it was trained; in other words, the model was fit to the input features and true output values of the training examples; on the other hand, the model never saw the true output values of the test examples. The goal is therefore to close the gap between the training performance and test performance, provided that the model performs well on the training set. A noticeable gap between the training performance and test performance is a sign of **overfitting**, an important topic we will address soon in the course."
